## **Theory**

- get bias from 4h OBs being rejected or respected
- when we get a big push aligning with our bias, wait for only one candle to go opposite direction, wait for 3 candles to continue the push. Enter within 30 minutes of candle close. TP at the high of the rebound. SL at the low of the opposite candle
